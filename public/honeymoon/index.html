          <h3>Got any tips for accomodation?</h3>

<p>Since we’re hoping to book shared minibuses from Bristol and Bath, you might want to consider staying in either of these fine cities; there’s plenty to see and do for the rest of the weekend!</p>

<p>If you do want to stay closer to the venue, then here are a couple of options:
<a href="http://snooty-fox.co.uk/">http://snooty-fox.co.uk/</a>
<a href="http://www.theprioryinn.co.uk/">http://www.theprioryinn.co.uk/</a>
<a href="http://theclose-hotel.com/">http://theclose-hotel.com/</a>
<a href="http://yorkhousetetbury.com/">http://yorkhousetetbury.com/</a>
<a href="http://www.number65.co.uk/">http://www.number65.co.uk/</a></p>

<h3>I&rsquo;m going to be free the night before. Can we party?</h3>

<p>The evening before the wedding we will be staying in central Bath, if anyone is free for an informal dinner, then let us know and we will book something and let you know the details.</p>

<h3>Isn’t it going to be really cold in November?</h3>

<p>All parts of the venue are accessible without going outside and we only anticipate dragging you all into the cold for a few photos and some spectacular fireworks, so you don’t have to worry about dressing for the arctic!</p>

<h3>What do you want me to wear?</h3>

<p>Just to be clear, there is no formal dress code, and we’re not looking to colour coordinate our guests. Suits for the guys, dresses for the girls. If either of these options makes you feel wildly uncomfortable then wear whatever you like.</p>

<h3>Do I need loads of cash on me?</h3>

<p>The only thing you need cash for is a taxi, if you are getting one. We are stocking a full free bar, which is an invitation to misbehave if ever there was one!</p>

<h3>Are you doing a gift list?</h3>

<p>While it is traditional for couples to ask for crockery and tea towels and suchlike as wedding gifts, we have been living together for some time and have everything we need for a life of wedded bliss!</p>

<p>We are however planning to go on a three week honeymoon to Thailand after the wedding, and any contribution to this would be much appreciated by both of us.</p>

<p>We have set up a website which allows you to pay money electronically to a paypal account that we can access. If you don’t like the idea of paying money electronically, there are cash and cheque options on the site as well.</p>
