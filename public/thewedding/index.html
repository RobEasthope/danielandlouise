<h3>So what is the Kingscote Barn?</h3>

<p>The entire day is going to be at Kingscote Barn near Tetbury. Kingscote Barn is a professional wedding venue so there won’t be any farmyard animals wandering around, everything is easily accessible and importantly, the whole venue will be well heated all day.</p>

<p>You can read more at www.kingscotebarn.co.uk</p>

<h3>Isn’t it going to be really cold in November?</h3>

<p>All parts of the venue are accessible without going outside and we only anticipate dragging you all into the cold for a few photos and some spectacular fireworks, so you don’t have to worry about dressing for the arctic!</p>

<h3>What do you want me to wear?</h3>

<p>Just to be clear, there is no formal dress code, and we’re not looking to colour coordinate our guests. Suits for the guys, dresses for the girls. If either of these options makes you feel wildly uncomfortable then wear whatever you like.</p>

<h3>Do I need loads of cash on me?</h3>

<p>The only thing you need cash for is a taxi, if you are getting one. We are stocking a full free bar, which is an invitation to misbehave if ever there was one!</p>

<h3>Getting there</h3>

<p>Kingscote Barn is in England, more specifically in Gloucestershire, near the village of Tetbury, in a secluded little valley in the Cotswolds.</p>

<p>Approximate driving times:
From Bristol &ndash; 40 minutes
From Bath &ndash; 45 minutes
From London &ndash; 2 hours 10 minutes</p>

<p>Transport on the day
We are planning on booking minibus taxis to get guests to the venue from the centre of Bristol and the centre of Bath, subject to demand. If you think this is a smashing idea and would like to partake, then drop an email to <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x64;&#97;&#x6e;&#105;&#x65;&#108;&#46;&#x68;&#111;&#108;&#x6c;&#x79;&#64;&#x68;&#x6f;&#116;&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x2e;&#117;&#107;&#46;">&#x64;&#97;&#x6e;&#x69;&#x65;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#104;&#x6f;&#108;&#x6c;&#121;&#64;&#x68;&#x6f;&#x74;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#46;&#117;&#x6b;&#x2e;</a> Once we know numbers we’ll get in touch with the rough cost per person.</p>

<p>If you’d like to arrange your own taxi, please be aware that the mobile signal at the venue is poor, and the local taxis will get booked up quickly, so book in advance.</p>

<p>There are plenty of parking spaces at the venue, and cars can be left onsite and collected the next day.</p>

<h2>Accommodation</h2>

<p>Since we’re hoping to book shared minibuses from Bristol and Bath (see the Getting there page), you might want to consider staying in either of these fine cities; there’s plenty to see and do for the rest of the weekend!</p>

<p>If you do want to stay closer to the venue, then here are a couple of options:

<h2>Night before</h2>

<p>The evening before the wedding we will be staying in central Bath, if anyone is free for an informal dinner, then let us know and we will book something and let you know the details.</p>
