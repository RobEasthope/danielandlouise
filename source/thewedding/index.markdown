###So what is the Kingscote Barn?###
(Kingscote photo to go here)
The entire day is going to be at Kingscote Barn near Tetbury. Kingscote Barn is a professional wedding venue so there won’t be any farmyard animals wandering around, everything is easily accessible and importantly, the whole venue will be well heated all day.

####Approximate driving times:####
From Bristol - 40 minutes
From Bath - 45 minutes
From London - 2 hours 10 minutes

###Taxi's to/from the venue###
We are planning on booking minibus taxis to get guests to the venue from the centre of Bristol and the centre of Bath, subject to demand. If you think this is a smashing idea and would like to partake, then drop an email to daniel.holly@hotmail.co.uk. Once we know numbers we’ll get in touch with the rough cost per person.

If you’d like to arrange your own taxi, please be aware that the mobile signal at the venue is poor, and the local taxis will get booked up quickly, so book in advance. 

###Parking###
There are plenty of parking spaces at the venue, and cars can be left onsite and collected the next day.
