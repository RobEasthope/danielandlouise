###Got any tips for accomodation?###
Since we’re hoping to book shared minibuses from Bristol and Bath, you might want to consider staying in either of these fine cities; there’s plenty to see and do for the rest of the weekend!

If you do want to stay closer to the venue, then here are a couple of options:

###I'm going to be free the night before. Can we party?###
The evening before the wedding we will be staying in central Bath, if anyone is free for an informal dinner, then let us know and we will book something and let you know the details.

###Are you doing a gift list?###
While it is traditional for couples to ask for crockery and tea towels and suchlike as wedding gifts, we have been living together for some time and have everything we need for a life of wedded bliss!

We are however planning to go on a three week honeymoon to Thailand after the wedding, and any contribution to this would be much appreciated by both of us. 

We have set up a website which allows you to pay money electronically to a paypal account that we can access. If you don’t like the idea of paying money electronically, there are cash and cheque options on the site as well.
